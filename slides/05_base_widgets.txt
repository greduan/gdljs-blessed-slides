% Blessed's base widgets

~Node~: The base from which everything inherits, handles a lot of low-level
stuff for you.

~Screen~: (Inherits from Node) The node that holds the nodes that will be
rendered, could be thought of as a ~<body>~ tag, but there can be multiple of
these and you can switch between which one you render.

~Element~: (Inherits from Node) The base element, i.e. box, text, etc.  Could be
thought of as a ~<div>~, you can hide it, show it, color it, change its size
etc.

Note that I compare it to HTML sometimes, but these are two very different
beasts.  Blessed's API is similar to the DOM though in some regards.
