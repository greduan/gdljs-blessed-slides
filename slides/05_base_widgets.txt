% Blessed's base widgets

Blessed offers a bunch of widgets to save you the trouble of dealing with the
raw terminal inputs.

~Node~: (Inherits from EventEmitter) The base from which everything inherits,
handles a lot of low-level stuff for you.

~Screen~: (Inherits from Node) The node that holds the nodes that will be
rendered, there can be multiple of these and you can switch between which one
you render, although apending elements is different then.

~Element~: (Inherits from Node) The base element, i.e. box, text, etc.  Could be
thought of as a ~<div>~, you can hide it, show it, color it, change its size
etc.

Note that I compare it to HTML sometimes, but these are two very different
beasts.  Blessed's API is similar to the DOM though in some regards.
