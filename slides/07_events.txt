% Widgets have events!

Every node has a ~.on()~ method, as the Node widget inherits from the
EventEmitter.

There's too many to list so go check out the documentation for all of them.

But here's an example:

    box.on('resize', function (data) {
      box.setContent('YOU CLICKED ME!')
      box.screen.render()
    })
