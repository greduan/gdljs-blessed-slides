% Parents and children

* Every element can have children and must have a parent, before being rendered.

* Some (not all) parent/children related methods:

  * ~.append()~
  * ~.remove()~
  * ~.insert()~
  * ~.detach()~

* An elements parent can be accessed with ~element.parent~ and its children with
  ~element.children~.  You can loop through the children!

* The parent's size limits its children's size.  If parent is height 3 children
  will not render beyond that height.
