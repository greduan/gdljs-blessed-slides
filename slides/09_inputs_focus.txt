% Inputs and focus

* Every element can have its own handler for mouse and keyboard inputs.

* Use ~.on('mouse', ...)~ for mouse inputs.

* Use ~.keys(...)~ for keyboard inputs.

  * ~.keys(['C-c', 'q'], function ...)~
  * ~.keys('C-c', function ...)~

* Focus dictates what element will get to handle the inputs.

Focus related stuff:

  * Every element has ~.focus()~ function
  * Every element has a ~.focused~ property
  * Every element has focus related events, including ~blur~ (loss of focus)
